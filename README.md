# Hi, I'm Heather.

### Creative Technologist in Chicago 🏙️

**I build interactive experiences that blend design, code, and technology.**

With **20+ years** of making things for the web, I operate at the intersection of visual design and technical execution. From Geocities to large-scale interactive airport exhibits, I use code as a means to an end: creating highly engaging digital moments.
